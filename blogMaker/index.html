 <!-- cr8 environment variable  .env part so secrets should not get uploaded on browser and no one can fetch it. here also we keep .env different and production also different eg- vercel, netlify, aws etc. in secret manager we cp pst this variables thier,
  accesiblity depend on framework or library eg- create react app, vite or next js 
  
  
  cr8 environment varible always on root not inside src but main project dir
  also we keep away from git ignore , righht click on file and addToGitIgnore 
  instead we .env.sample but empty out varibles


  access is different in each in create react app - REACT_APP_VAR but in vite VITE_ in next its different

  //console.log(process.env.REACT_APP_APPWRITE_URL); //this is for create react app for vite its VITE_
  console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_URL); //here we access like this

#enable permission all users inside collection
add attributes under collection - userId, title, content, status and featuredImage
cr8 index status- ASC
cr8 storage/bucket and images and get its bucket id and permission like above to all

APPWRITE is BACKEND AS A SERVICE



  //but more standard way to do it src/conf/conf.js since it may psbl that varible not load with above since env var all in string may number also psbl which cant accessible

  <!-- 
  now we cr8/use appwrite services in appwrite/auth.js

We use React Hook Form (there's good one but we use this)
register we use and handleSubit() method in Login.jsx as login()
handleSubmit method allows our method which is login to submit the form in onSubmit event action of form
{...register} this is compulsion in <Input> field otherwise values will override when input used in elsewhere

  {/* placeholder will go by ...props above */}
  {/*async(data) will based on this register("email") part*/}
